# minecraft-mac-window-fix
Fixes some issues with Minecraft on macOS.  
This project will fix the following Minecraft bugs on macOS:  
[MCL-15163](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCL-15163)  
[MC-145948](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-145948)

# Other fixes:
This will also enable macOS Dark Mode support for the title bar and fix microphone permission issues with some mods (will ask if bash wants to use the microphone).

# Installation:
Clone this repo, and then run the install.sh file. It will tell you want the path you have to set your Java executable to.

# Note:
Doing this will make the game output in the launcher not work. If "Open output log when Minecraft: Java Edition starts" is disabled in the launcher settings, then you will not notice this at all.
